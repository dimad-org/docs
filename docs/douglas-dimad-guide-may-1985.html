     The present guide corresponds to the program version dated JULY 14
     1989.<p>
     The program DIMAD studies particle  behaviour in circular machines
     and in beam lines.</p><p>
       The trajectories of the particles  are computed according to the
     second order matrix formalism<sup>(<a href="#references">1</a>)</sup>.  
     It does not provide synchrotron
     motion analysis  but can simulate  it.   The program  provides the
     user with the possibility of defining arbitrary elements to tailor
     the program to specific uses.  The present version of DIMAD is not
     fully debugged.  Please inform one  of the following persons about
     any anomalies observed:

</h2></center>
     DIMAD,like its predecessor DIMAT,  is the  result of many years of
     experimenting  with several  different  charged particle  computer
     codes.<p>
     In 1970 the  first author had the good fortune  of discovering the
     program OSECO (Optique du SECond Ordre)  written by J.L.LACLARE at
     SACLAY.  Basically OSECO was a second order Tracking program.   It
     was based  on the second order  matrix formalism of  TRANSPORT and
     was originally written for a CDC computer.   Its usefulness in the
     simulation of the extraction procedure  of the Beam Stretcher ALIS
     and later of EROS led to the  desire for a program that would have
     more analysis power.   The first attempt  to develop a new program
     resulted  in  the program  DEPART  which  was  written as  a  pure
     differential equation ray tracing program but it soon became clear
     that DEPART was very awkward to  use because of the cumbersome way
     in  which  bending   magnets  were  defined  in   the  code.    An
     evolutionary  process then  took place  over a  period of  several
     years finally resulting in the present program called DIMAD.</p><p>
     Many  people contributed  in various  ways to  the development  of
     DIMAT.    Dr Leon  Katz,   while he  was  Director  of the  Linear
     Accelerator Laboratory at Saskatoon,   provided strong support for
     the work.  Sheila Flory, Dean Jones, Edward Pokraka, Jim Morrison,
     and Jean Mary Miketinac provided  programming support at different
     times during the initial program development.  Ideas were borrowed
     freely  from  the program  OSECO  and  Jean Louis  Laclare  helped
     formulate some of  the early developments.   Karl L  Brown of SLAC
     became influential during the later development phases.  He helped
     formulate the more recent contributions  to the program (geometric
     aberrations,  linear analysis of motion around arbitrary reference
     orbits,  and magnet  misalignment simulations).   It is  for these
     reasons that he has become a coauthor of the present manual.</p><p>
       The  authors  wish  to  thank the  many  DIMAT  users  of  other
     laboratories for  their comments  and assistance  in locating  the
     many programming errors that have occurred during the evolution of
     DIMAD.</p></a><p><a name="introduction">
     In 1984,  it became clear that  tracking codes should operate in a
     canonical  environment  ,should  provide  options  for  symplectic
     tracking and should conform to the input 
     STANDARD<sup>(</sup></a><a href="#references">2</a>).
     </p><p>
     Adapting  the  input   code  of  MAD<sup>(<a href="#references">3</a>)</sup>,    
     Lindsay  Schachinger
     transformed the program so it would enjoy a common input with MAD,
     thereby conforming to the input STANDARD.</p><p>
     With  ideas developed  originally by  
     E.Forest<sup>(<a href="#references">4</a>)</sup>,  David  Douglas
     introduced  the  symplectic  tracking options  and  the  canonical
     variables.

     The  input format  to  dimad now  conforms  quite  closely to  the
     standard format,  as laid out in references 2.  This conversion of
     dimad  to standard  input  was accomplished  by  taking the  input
     subroutines from  the program MAD  (Reference 3)  and  making from
     these routines (with modifications) an input interface for dimad.<p>
     One exception to the standard format is the units conventions.</p></a><p><a name="element_and_machine_data_input">
     Input to dimad can be in  either transport units (indicated by the
     keyword "utransport"),   or in  standard units  (indicated by  the
     keyword "ustandard").  For more information on units, see the next
     section.  The second difference between  dimad and the standard is
     the addition of  several keywords for dimad.    The added keywords
     are  "quadsext",   "gkick",   and "mtwiss."   These  elements  are
     described more fully later.  Also, in dimad, the solenoid can have
     a quadrupole field.  Elements which are described in references 
     </a><a href="#references">2</a>,
     but which are not implemented in dimad are separator and rbend.</p><p>
     The job  title entered on  a line  following one with  the keyword
     "title." This should be followed with a units keyword. If no units
     keyword is found, the units are assumed to be the standard units.

     When describing the machine,  a statement  can be continued on the
     next line by ending the current line  with a "&amp;".   A comment line
     begins with  a "!".    Any line containing  one of  the characters
     "*","(","@" in the first column is treated as a comment.<p>
      A ";" is used to separate  statements on the same line.  Keywords
     are uniquely specified by the first  four letters,  and only those
     four must be entered. At most 8 letters in a keyword are checked.</p><p>
      The keyword  NOECHO can be used  to suppress transmission  of the

     Parameters are defined with a statement like
<pre>             pname = value
</pre>
      where pname is any parameter name. Parameters can then be used in
     element definitions.  Value  can also be an  arithmetic expression
     involving other parameters.  Throughout the element definitions, a
     parameter value can also be an arithmetic expression. Note that in
     dimad the relationships  between parameters are lost,   but during
     the machine definition phase they are treated correctly.
      <p>Examples:
</p><pre>             lslot=100
             lb=lslot/8
             lh = sqrt(lslot)
</pre>
     <b>Note</b>:  the  value of  PI if  needed must  be defined  as an  input
     parameter.   the  value halfturn must  be understood as  either PI
     radians or as 180 degrees depending on the units chosen.

         l        is the length.

  sbend
         l        is the length.
         angle    is the bend angle.
         k1       If the standard convention is being used, k1 is given
                  by  the field  expansion in  the  UNITS section.   If
                  transport  conventions are  being used,   k1  is n  =
                  -rho(dBo/dx)/Bo.
         e1       is the entrance edge angle.
         e2       is the exit edge angle.
         tilt     is the tilt angle.  If tilt is entered with no value,
                  halfturn/2 is assumed.
         k2       If the standard convention is being used, k2 is given
                  by  the field  expansion in  the  UNITS section.   If
                  transport  conventions   are  being   used,   k2   is
                  beta=rho**2(d2Bo/dx2)/(2Bo).
         h1       is the entrance pole face curvature.
         h2       is the exit pole face curvature.
         hgap     is the entrance half gap size.  If hgapx is not given
                  a value,  it  defaults to the value  of hgap.  During
                  fitting, however,  both hgap and hgapx must be varied
                  together.
         fint     is the entrance fringe field integral, which defaults
                  to 0.5.   If fintx is not given a value,  it defaults
                  to the value of fint.  During fitting, however,  both
                  fint and fintx must be varied together.
                          hgapx    is the exit half gap size. See hgap.
                          fintx    is  the exit fringe  field integral.
                  See fint.

  rbend </pre>
 The rbend is  a parallel faced dipole magnet.  Its  parameters are the
 same as those of the sbend.  Parameters  e1 and e2 are not provided by
 the user  and are set  by the program  to half  the value of  the bend
 angle. <pre>
 quadrupole
         l        is the length.
         k1       is the strength.
         tilt     is the tilt angle.  If tilt is entered with no value,
                  halfturn/4 is assumed.
         aperture is the magnet aperture for the Hardware operation.

 sextupole
         l        is the length.
         k2       is the strength.
         tilt     is the tilt angle.  If tilt is entered with no value,
                  halfturn/6 is assumed.
         aperture is the magnet aperture for the Hardware operation.

 quadsext
         l        is the length.
         k1       is the quadrupole strength.
         k2       is the sextupole strength.
         tilt     is the tilt angle.  If tilt is entered with no value,
                  halfturn/4 is assumed.
         aperture is the magnet aperture for the Hardware operation.
 
 octupole
         l        is the strength.
         k3       is the strength.
         tilt     is the tilt angle.  If tilt is entered with no value,
                  halfturn/8 is assumed.
         aperture is the magnet aperture for the Hardware operation.

 multipole
         l        is the length.  If the length is zero,  the strengths
                  are interpreted as integrated strengths.
         k0 - k20 are the strengths.
         t0 - t20 are  the tilt  angles.  If  tn is  entered without  a
                  value, halfturn/2(n+1) is assumed.
         scalefac is a dimensionless strength factor, used to scale all
                  the strengths together.
         tilt     is the overall tilt angle.
         aperture is the magnet aperture for the Hardware operation.
</pre>
 <b>NOTE1</b> :  only the components with  non zero amplitude are  stored!  If
                  zero  components need  be  kept  for the  purpose  of
                  generating errors via the ERROR definition then enter
                  components with small amplitudes.
<p>
 <b>NOTE2</b> : when a quadrupole  or a  sextupole  component  is present  the
                  matrix of  this component  is computed  for half  the
                  length of  the multipole.  This  does not  change the
                  value  of  the  total second  order  matrix.   During
                  tracking operations the particles are tracked through
                  half the element as quadrupole  or sextupole then the
                  higher  order multipole  kicks  are  applied and  the
                  particles are tracked through the  second half of the
                  quadrupole or  sextupole component.  This  feature is
                  important  in  computing  misalignment  effects  with
                  multipole components present.
</p><pre> solenoid
         l        is the length.
         ks       is the solenoid strength. ks=0.5*Bs/Brho.
         k1       is the quadrupole strength.
         tilt     is the tilt angle.  If tilt is entered with no value,
                  halfturn/4 is assumed.
         aperture is the magnet aperture for the Hardware operation.

 rfcavity
         l        is the length.
         volt     is the cavity voltage.(kV for Utransport)
         lag      is the  phase lag  of the  cavity with  respect to  a
                  nominal particle  (0,0,0,0,0,0)  at the start  of the
                  machine.(Degrees for Utransport)
         freq     is the frequency of the cavity.(Hz for Utransport) In
                  program  versions dated  July 14  1989  or later  the
                  frequency is  defined via the harmonic  number.  This
                  has the  advantage to match  the frequency  with full
                  accuracy to  the length  of the  machine.   When  the
                  frequency must be not matched a non integer value for
                  the harmonic number is entered. Note that the keyword
                  has  remained  FREQ  (until   further  notice).   The
                  particle type (electrons or protons)  is selected via
                  the constant definition operation.
         energy   is the energy.(GeV)

 roll
  This element performs  a rotation of the coordinate  system about the
  longitudinal axis. 
         angle    is the rotation angle. A positive angle means the new
                  coordinate system is  rotated clockwise about  the s-
                  axis with respect to the old system.

 zrot 
  This element performs  a rotation of the coordinate  system about the
  vertical axis. The angle must be small. 
         angle    is the rotation angle. A positive angle means the new
                  coordinate  system  is rotated  clockwise  about  the
                  local z-axis with respect to the old system.

 hkick, vkick 
  These  elements are  translated  by the  program  into general  kicks
  (gkick). 
         kick     a horizontal (vertical) kick of size kick,
         angle    about the longitudinal axis.

 gkick
  This element is a general kick.
         l        is the length.
         dx       is the change in x.
         dxp      is the change in x'.
         dy       is the change in y.
         dyp      is the change in y'.
         dl       is the change in path length.
         dp       is the change in dp/p.
         angle    is  the  angle  through  which  the  coordinates  are
                  rotated about the longitudinal axis.
         dz       is the longitudinal displacement.
         v        is the  extrance-exit parameter  of the  kick.  v  is
                  positive for an  entrance kick,  and negative  for an
                  exit kick.   The absolute value of v is used to force
                  the  kick to  be applied  every  abs(v)  turns.   The
                  default value of v is 1.
         t        is the momentum dependence  parameter.  The kicks dx'
                  and dy' can  be thought of as  misalignment errors or
                  as angle kicks of orbit correctors. In the first case
                  (t=0)  they  are momentum independent.  When  t=1 the

                  When t is set to a negative integer value -n the kick
                  is applied every turn and  the momentum of a particle
                  with  initial momentum  p will  oscillate around  the
                  nominal  momentum p0  with  amplitude  (p-p0)  and  a
                  period equal to n turns.  More than one such kick may
                  be put in the line  (all identical though)  the phase
                  of  the cosine  oscillation  is  proportional to  the
                  pathlength of the reference trajectory.

 hmon, vmon, monitor
  These elements are horizontal, vertical,  and horizontal and vertical
  monitors, respectively.
         l        is the monitor length.
         xserr,
         yserr,
         xrerr,
         yrerr    are the x and y systematic and random errors.
</pre>
 <b>NOTE</b>: the errors are not  used in  this form  presently.   Errors  are
                  introduced via the misalignement operations.
<pre> marker
  A marker is a drift element of zero length. It has no parameters.

 ecollimator, rcollimator
  An ecollimator is elliptic,  and an rcollimator is rectangular.   The
  particles  are  checked  at  the  entrance and  at  the  exit  of  the

 collimator.
         l        is the length.
         xsize
         ysize    are the  x and y  collimator apertures.   The default
                  apertures are 1 meter.

 arbitelm
  This is the arbitrary element.  Its parameters  are used in the user-
  supplied  routine  TRAFCT,   which   contains  the  transfer  function
  describing  the  effect  of  arbitrary   elements  on  the  individual
  particles.  All arbitrary elements use  the same subroutine.  Distinct
  arbitrary elements can  only be recognized by the  program through the
  use of one parameter as a flag.
         l        is the length.
         p1 - p20 are the parameters.

 mtwiss
         l        is the length.
         mux,
         betax,
         alphax,
         muy,
         betay,
         alphay   are the  twiss parameters  for this  transfer matrix.
                  betax and betay have default values of 1.
 matrix
  This element is a general transfer matrix.
         rij
         tijk     are the matrix elements.  i,j,  and k range from 1 to
                  6, but j is always less than or equal to k.

  A beamline is a list of elements, which can include other beamlines.
<pre>         label: line=(member1, member2, member3,.....)
</pre>
  denotes a beamline called label.  The members can be elements,  other
 beamlines,  sequences of members,  or any  of the above preceeded by a
 repetition count and/or a minus sign for reflection.
  <p>Examples are
</p><pre>         df:line = (dq, oo, b, oo qf)
         fdstar:line = (qf, sf, b, sd, qd)
         arc:line = (df, 64*(fdstar,df))
</pre>
  Beamlines can also have formal arguments. An example is
<pre>         fdstar(sf,sd):line = (qf, sf, b, sd, qd)
</pre>
  where sf and sd are not defined elements, but variables. So
<pre>         super:line = (fdstar(sd1,sf1),df,fdstar(sd2,sf2))
</pre>
  is  a line  in  which the  elements  sd1,  sd2,   sf1,   and sf2  are
 substituted for the variables sd and sf in the original definition.

   Beamline definitions are followed by a use statement in the form
<pre>         use, beamlinename.
</pre>
  This causes the  beamline beamlinename to be the  current machine for
 dimad.
<p>
  Next comes the statement
</p><pre>        dimat
</pre>
  which passes control to dimad, after translating the machine into the
 correct data  structures for  dimad.  Any  dimad command  can then  be
 issued.
<p>
 A  ';' will  cause  dimad to  stop  and return  control  to the  input
 interface.  Now the user can define a  new machine and then go back to
 dimad and  do a new calculation,   or stop execution with  the command
 stop.   The use command causes the old machine to be replaced by a new
 one.  This  new machine  can be a  previously defined  beamline.   For
 debugging purposes, the dump command from MAD has been retained.  This
 command produces a dump of the  MAD-type data structure describing the
 machine.
  After a ";" and return to MAD control,   one can specify the use of a
 new line  ,  keeping the previously  defined (and perhaps  modified by
 dimad) elements.To do so one uses the commands :
</p><pre>  use,newlinename
  newbeam
</pre> 
  The last command "newbeam" passes control back to dimad.
 Observe that without newbeam all  the element parameters are redefined
 to their initial input values.
<p>
 A new MAD command is introduced : EXPLODE .
  Its purpose  is to  provide an explicit  description of  the beamline
 used.

    pkeyw      keyword of parameter to be varied (i.e. k1 for a quad)

    nopt       option number
                1  means variation  will  be  linear according  to  the
                following  rule:   the  parameter  remains constant  at
                value  val1  until  turn p1  then  varies  linearly  to
                achieve the value val2 at turn  p2.   In this case only
                two parameter p's and only  two values vali are present
                in the input format
                2 means the  variation will be sinusoidal  between turn
                p1 and turn  p2.The variation is done  according to the
                formula :
                 value = val1 + val2*sin((2pi*turn/val3)+val4)
                where  turn  is the  current  turn  at which  value  is

    E           momentum (GeV/c) used for computation of field values.

    s x y z     coordinates  of   starting  point   in  some   absolute
                reference coordinate  system.  The coordinate s  is the
                length of arc along the reference trajectory.To justify
                the choice of the angles theta, phi, and psi,  the axis
                z should  coincide more or  less with  the longitudinal
                axis of  the beam.   The  angles theta,  phi,   and psi
                describe the motion needed to bring the absolute system
                of reference  in coincidence with  the local  system of
                coordinates.   The  local system of coordinates  is the
                system used by  the program.  Its z axis  is tangent to
                the reference trajectory.  The x axis (uniquely defined
                by the bends) is in the midplane of symmetry and points
                outwards of the bend.   The  y axis completes the local
                right  handed  system  of  reference.    To  bring  the
                absolute system in coincidence with the local reference
                system,  one executes the following rotations (strictly
                in the order indicated):
                   A rotation  theta around the  y axis  (positive when
                   the z axis turns towards the x axis)
                   A rotation phi around the  x axis (positive when the
                   z axis turns towards the y axis: i.e. points upwards
                   for a bend deflecting the beam to the right)
                   A rotation  psi (called sometimes the  roll)  around
                   the z axis  (positive when the x  axis turns towards
                   the y axis)

    conv        conversion  factor to  enable the  printout in  various

                for example  0.3048 (the length  of a foot  in meters).
                The program recognizes yards,  feet,  inches,  cm,  mm,
                microns.   However,  any conversion  factor is accepted
                even if not recognized.

 This operation  defines a  baseline resulting  from surveying  errors.
 The baseline  must be considered  like a  new reference orbit.   It is
 obtained by two  successive operations.  In the first a  few points on
 the original reference orbit are chosen as main surveying points.   In
 tunnel  construction they  could  be  associated with  the  surveyor's
 penetration points.  They  are accompanied by random  x,y,z coordinate
 errors (usually rather  big :  say 5  to 10 mm)  The  second operation
 defines between the preceding basepoints intermediate points which are
 obtained  by successive  aiming from  the  current point  to the  next
 basepoint.  This  aiming is accompanied  by a systematic  aiming error
 (varying from segment to segment) to which is added a random aim error
 (usually  smaller  than  the  systematic error)   The  origin  of  the
 systematic error can  be due to the  instruments used but also  due to
 ambient  conditions under  which the  surveying  is performed.    This
 operation MUST  BE PRECEDED by a  SEED operation.   This  operation is
 still being tested and developped.  Use at OWN RISK.

<pre> Parameters:
</pre>
    For all values of the option  parameter,  the parameters dz and dzr
    are the  values of the  longitudinal displacement and  the rotation
    angle (in  radians!!)  around  the longitudinal  axis.  The  values
    dm1,dm2,dm3 and dm4 are assumed to  be small (either in displaments
    or angles).   The  program uses approximate formulae to  set up the
    misaligned element.<p>
    The  parameter option  can take  the three  values 1,2  or 3  which
    determines the nature of the misalignment
</p><pre>      option = 1   The element is misaligned around  the tangent to the
                   central trajectory at the  entrance of the elements.
                   In this case the parameters  dm1,dm2,dm3 and dm4 are
                   respectively dx,dxr,dy,dyr  where dx and dy  are the
                   displacements along  the axes x  and y and  dxr ,dyr
                   are rotation angles (in radians)   around the axes x
                   and y respectively.

      option = 2   The element  is misaligned around the  chord defined
                   by the two extreme points of the central trajectory.
                   In this case the parameters  dm1,dm2,dm3 and dm4 are
                   dx1,dx2,dy1,dy2 where dx1,dy1  are the displacements
                   at the entrance of the element  along the axes x and
                   y.   The parameters dx2,dy2 are the displacements at
                   the exit of the element along the axes x and y

      option = 3   The element is misaligned around  the tangent to the
                   central trajectory  at the midpoint of  the element.
                   The  parameters dm1,dm2,dm3  and dm4  have the  same
                   meaning as in the case of the option value 1.

      option = 4   This does not apply to  dipole elements (Bends).  In
                   this  case  the  parameters dm1  and  dm3  represent
                   displacements in x and y respectively.  The particle
                   is also subjected at the entrance and the exit to an
                   angle kick of dm2/2 and dm/4 in x and y respectively
                   (same sign at  exit as at entrance).This  enables to
                   simulate baseline excursion in a similar way as that
                   defined under baseline operation.  Parameters dz dzr
                   are in  effect but  not ddel.This  should be  mainly
                   used on monitors.

    opt   option number defining the kind of corrector

    p1...p4 the four parameters used to define the corrector.

    if opt = 0  p1  is  dx,p2 is  dy,p3  is  dy'  and  p4 is  ddel  The
                corrector element is displaced uniformly  by dx and dy.
                It is  preceded and  followed by  a momentum  dependent
                kick  of dy'  (this  simulates  crudely the  effect  of
                backleg windings providing a  Bx induction)  The energy
                of the particle is changed  by ddel (This simulates the
                effect of backleg windings providing a change in By)

       opt = 1  the parameters have the same definition as above.   The
                displacement dx and  dy are imposed at  the entrance of
                the magnet.   The exit point  of the magnet  is assumed
                fixed. The operation of dy' and ddel remain the same as
                above

       opt = 2  As for option  1 the parameters keep  their definition.
                This time the  entrance is fixed and  the displacements
                dx and  dy are imposed at  the exit of the  magnet.  In
                both  cases 1  and 2  a momentum  independent slope  is
                computed and imposed on the magnet.

       opt = 3  In  this option  the corrector  acts as  a pure  dipole
                steering magnet.  Parameter 1 is dxp and parameter 2 is
                dyp.  Parameter 3 and 4 are  not used.  The angle kicks
                dxp and dyp are inversely  proportional to the momentum
                of the partical(ie:  dxp and dyp are divided by 1+delta

 This operation defines the random  generation mode,  the elements that

 line where they must be misaligned.
<pre> Parameters:
    nopt        choice option for the random generators

           0    the elements are  misaligned by the fixed  values given
                in the MISA... operation.  No randomness is introduced.

           1    The misalignment values are obtained by multiplying the
                values given  in the  MISA...   operation  by +1  or -1
                randomly generated.

            2   A  uniform distribution  is  generated  having the  rms
                values defined by the MISA... operation.

            3   A Gaussian  distribution truncated  above two  standard
                deviations is generated  with the rms value  defined by
                the MISA... operation.

            4   A Gaussian  distribution truncated  above six  standard
                deviations is generated  with the rms value  defined by

            0   all element  with that name  are misaligned.    In this
                case no interval range is given.
           -1   no element with the name are misaligned.   In this case
                no interval range is given.

    nb nf       beginning  and end  of  range  of misaligned  elements.
                These numbers  correspond to  the order  number in  the
                machine list.

 Parameters

 option   determines the information to be printed out.

           1    The rms, maxima and minima of the values are displayed

           2    name
                   This  option  prints  the  values 1  and  2  of  the
                correctors  with the  label name  .   These values  are
                multiplied by  the scale  factor SIGFAC  as defined  in
                Constant definition.
 
           3    Under  this option  the values  of  the correctors  are
                printed out in the format accepted  as input by the SET
                Correctors operation.   This can be  used to set  up an
                input file for a misaligned and corrected machine which
                can be  then studied  without executing  the alignement
                correction procedures.

              Energy option randomoption,

           Parameters

    Energy   Initial nominal energy in GeV

    option   0 no synchrotron radiation effect is simulated.
             1 synchrotron radiation loss is  computed in every dipole.
                Particles lose that energy at  the entrance and exit of
                the magnet.
             2 synchrotron emittance  growth is simulated  randomly for
                each particle.  This growth is due to the spread in the
                energy loss of the particles.  This effect is simulated
                only in the dipoles.
             3 both the  radiation loss and  the emitttance  growth are
                simulate in the dipoles only.
             4 synchrotron radiation is simulated in  the dipoles as in
                option  2  to  which is  added  a  synchrotron  quantum
                fluctuation in the quadrupoles.
             5 synchrotron radiation is simulated in  the dipoles as in
                option  3  to  which is  added  a  synchrotron  quantum
                fluctuation in the quadrupoles.

    randomoption:  choice  of the random  generator,  applies  to above
                options 2 and 3 only.
             1 the  random  generator  is  binary   +  and  -  randomly
                affecting  the  energy spread  creating  the  emittance
                growth.
             2 the random generator is uniform
             3 the random generator  is gaussian :  note  that here the
                execution time  will be considerably greater  than with
                choice 2 for the options 2 and 3 above which enable the
                emittance growth calculations.
            11,12,13 the fast  random generator is used  to produce the
                sequence  of  random  numbers.  This  sequence  may  be
                affected  by some  unwanted correlations.   In case  of
                doubt use the options 1,2 or 3.
