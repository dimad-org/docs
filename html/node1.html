Introduction</A>
</H1>
The present guide corresponds to the  program version dated JUNE 01
1993.

<P>
The program DIMAD studies particle  behaviour in circular machines
and in beam lines.

<P>
The trajectories of the particles  are computed according to the
second order matrix formalism[<A
 HREF="node56.html#klb">1</A>].  It does not provide synchrotron
motion analysis  but can simulate  it.   The program  provides the
user with the possibility of defining arbitrary elements to tailor
the program to specific uses.  The present version of DIMAD is not
fully debugged.  Please inform one  of the following persons about
any anomalies observed:
<PRE><TT>
 David Douglas at CEBAF 804/249 7512 
<BR>
Roger Servranckx at Gabriola 604/247-9567
</TT></PRE>
DIMAD,like its predecessor DIMAT,  is the  result of many years of
experimenting  with several  different  charged particle  computer
codes.

<P>
In 1970 the  first author had the good fortune  of discovering the
program OSECO (Optique du SECond Ordre)  written by J.L.LACLARE at
SACLAY.  Basically OSECO was a second order Tracking program.   It
was based  on the second order  matrix formalism of  TRANSPORT and
was originally written for a CDC computer.   Its usefulness in the
simulation of the extraction procedure  of the Beam Stretcher ALIS
and later of EROS led to the  desire for a program that would have
more analysis power.   The first attempt  to develop a new program
resulted  in  the program  DEPART  which  was  written as  a  pure
differential equation ray tracing program but it soon became clear
that DEPART was very awkward to  use because of the cumbersome way
in  which  bending   magnets  were  defined  in   the  code.    An
evolutionary  process then  took place  over a  period of  several
years finally resulting in the present program called DIMAD.
Many  people contributed  in various  ways to  the development  of
DIMAT.    Dr Leon  Katz,   while he  was  Director  of the  Linear
Accelerator Laboratory at Saskatoon,   provided strong support for
the work.  Sheila Flory, Dean Jones, Edward Pokraka, Jim Morrison,
and Jean Mary Miketinac provided  programming support at different
times during the initial program development.  Ideas were borrowed
freely  from  the program  OSECO  and  Jean Louis  Laclare  helped
formulate some of  the early developments.   Karl L  Brown of SLAC
became influential during the later development phases.  He helped
formulate the more recent contributions  to the program (geometric
aberrations,  linear analysis of motion around arbitrary reference
orbits,  and magnet  misalignment simulations).   It is  for these
reasons that he has become a coauthor of the present manual.

<P>
The  authors  wish  to  thank the  many  DIMAT  users  of  other
laboratories for  their comments  and assistance  in locating  the
many programming errors that have occurred during the evolution of
DIMAD.

<P>
In 1984,  it became clear that  tracking codes should operate in a
canonical  environment  ,should  provide  options  for  symplectic
tracking and should conform to the input STANDARD [<A
 HREF="node56.html#standard1">2</A>]
[<A
 HREF="node56.html#standard2">3</A>].
Adapting  the  input   code  of  MAD  [<A
 HREF="node56.html#mad">4</A>],    Lindsay  Schachinger
transformed the program so it would enjoy a common input with MAD,
thereby conforming to the input STANDARD.

<P>
With  ideas developed  originally by  E.Forest[<A
 HREF="node56.html#forest">5</A>],  David  Douglas
introduced  the  symplectic  tracking options  and  the  canonical
variables.
